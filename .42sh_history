    th first and last may be specified as a string (to locate the most recent command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number). If last is not specified, it is set to first. If first is not specified, it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing. If the -l flag is given, the commands are listed on standard output. The -n flag suppresses the command numbers when listing. The -r flag reverses the order of the listing. Otherwise, the editor given by ename is invoked on a file containing those commands. If ename is not given, the value of the following variable expansion is used: ${FCEDIT:-${EDITOR:-vi}}. This says to use the value of the FCEDIT variable if set, or the value of the EDITOR variable if that is set, or vi if neither is set. When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.
    In the second form, command is re-executed after each instance of pat in the selected command is replaced by rep. command is intepreted the same as first above.
    A useful alias to use with the fc command is r='fc -s', so that typing âhe last command beginning with cc and typing â€˜râ€™ re-executes the last command (see Aliases).
